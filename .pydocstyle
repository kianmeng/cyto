# D104: Missing docstring in public package (e.g., in __init__.py)
# D105: Magic methods such as __enter__ and __exit__
# D106: Missing docstring in public nested class. This one is more
#       trouble than it's worth. Pydantic, for instance, use nested
#       nested `Config` classes. This results in a lot of false
#       positives.
# D107: __init__ method
